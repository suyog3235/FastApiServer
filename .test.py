In the realm of code and data flow,  
Where APIs and servers grow,  
There lives a Fast API, swift and bright,  
Bringing solutions day and night.

It dances through requests with ease,  
Solving queries as it please,  
From morning sun to evening star,  
It crafts responses near and far.

In the digital world, it's quite the charmer,  
Always ready, never a stammer,  
So hereâ€™s to the Fast API Server's grace,  
In the grand tech cosmos, it finds its place.
